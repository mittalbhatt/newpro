How to Read This Diagram (Simple Steps):

1. Request is Made: An employee or their manager asks for special software they don't normally have. (e.g., "I need Photoshop for 3 days").
2. Override Engine Handles It: The "Exception Boss" (Override Engine) takes the request and does three things:
   · Creates a Temporary Permission Slip: This is a digital rule that says "Okay, but only for 3 days."
   · Sends a Bypass Command: It tells the main "Strict Boss" to ignore the normal rules for this one case.
   · Logs & Starts a Timer: It notes down who asked, what for, and when the permission expires. The clock starts ticking.
3. Main Engine Applies Exception: The main "Strict Boss" (Epigenetic Engine) gets the command and immediately installs the software (Photoshop), even though it's normally against the rules.
4. Automatic Cleanup: When the timer runs out, the Override Engine automatically deletes the permission slip. This forces the Main Engine to revert to the original rules and uninstall the software automatically. No one has to remember to do it manually.
