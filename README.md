You are an expert UI engineer and solution architect.
Create a simple HTML + CSS + JavaScript demo to explain an Agentic AI concept for a banking innovation challenge.

Requirements:
1. Create a single-page HTML app titled:
   "Agentic AI – Proactive Production Issue Detection"

2. Page Sections:
   - Header with bank-style professional UI
   - Left panel: "Splunk Logs Input"
     - Show sample logs including:
       - API 404 error
       - Account close success message
       - Telephony issue log
   - Middle panel: "Agentic AI Analysis"
     - Animated steps:
       - Log scanning
       - Pattern detection
       - Root cause analysis
       - Business impact evaluation
   - Right panel: "AI Decision & Actions"

3. Agentic AI Output Panel should display:
   - Issue Identified: Credit Card Account Closure API Failure
   - Root Cause: API returning 404 after successful UI flow
   - Business Impact: Sales team missing closed account records
   - Priority: HIGH (highlight in red)
   - Actions Taken:
     - Email sent to L2/L3/L4 team
     - Incident ticket created
     - Escalation triggered

4. Add a "Run Agentic AI" button:
   - On click, simulate AI processing using JavaScript timeouts
   - Show step-by-step analysis messages

5. Design:
   - Clean banking UI
   - Use cards, icons, and color indicators
   - No backend required
   - Use dummy data only

6. Include comments explaining how this simulates real Agentic AI behavior.

Goal:
The demo should help non-technical judges instantly understand how Agentic AI replaces manual Splunk analysis and prevents production escalations.
