How It Works: A Simple Example

Normal Situation:

· Raj is a developer. His laptop automatically has coding software (like Docker) and no sales software.

The Exception:

· Raj needs to help the sales team for a week and requires the Sales CRM software.

Without an Override Engine: An IT person would have to manually install the software on Raj's laptop.Then, next week, they'd have to remember to manually uninstall it.

With the Override Engine:

1. Raj or his manager clicks a button that says: "Give Raj the Sales software for 7 days."
2. The Override Engine creates a temporary "permission slip" for this exception.
3. The main Epigenetic Engine sees this slip and instantly installs the Sales software on Raj's laptop.
4. Crucially, after 7 days, the Override Engine automatically deletes the permission slip.
5. The main Epigenetic Engine notices the slip is gone and immediately uninstalls the Sales software, putting Raj's laptop back to its normal developer setup. No one has to remember to do anything.
