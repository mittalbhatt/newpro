Presentation Speech: NG16 Upgrade Automation
Introduction
Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone,
I am excited to present our NG16 Upgrade Automation process, which significantly optimizes the upgrade workflow of Angular components. Our goal with this automation is to reduce manual effort, improve efficiency, and enhance accuracy, ensuring that our BUICs stay up to date with the latest Angular features.

Existing Approach & Challenges
Let’s first look at our existing upgrade process. As shown in the left section of the slide, the traditional approach involves multiple manual steps:

Installing Angular CLI Dependencies
Executing ETP package dependencies
Adding Angular Element & Webpack dependencies
Modifying build configurations in common files
Integrating Husky & Checkmarx for security & code validation
This process is time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to errors, making it difficult to scale efficiently across multiple components.

Automation Approach & Key Benefits
To address these challenges, we have developed an NG16 Upgrade Automation Script using Node.js and packaged it as an executable using Electron. The automation script streamlines the process into a single execution flow, reducing manual intervention and making upgrades seamless.

Here’s how our automation improves the workflow:

Element Bundle Approach & Webpack Bundle Approach
The script supports both custom Webpack bundling and Angular Element-based bundling, ensuring flexibility.
Automated Validation & Checkmarx Integration
Eliminates the need for manual validation by integrating Checkmarx security scanning.
Husky Pre-Commit Hook Automation
Ensures that all commits meet code quality and security standards automatically.
Electron-Based Execution
We packaged the automation as an executable (EXE) using Electron, making it easy for any developer to use without requiring a Node.js setup.
Hosting the Upgraded Application in Different Environments
The script allows seamless deployment and testing in various environments post-upgrade.
