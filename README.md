Angualr existing approch when we upgrade buic ng 2 to 10 or 16 fist we need to install angualr dependencies to generate basic schema of buic than second to generate miffed or compressed bundle file currently we are using webpack approch so developer nmedto install all webpack dependencies manually and as per etp standard need to do customization in angualr comman file for this we have around 20 steps thank third to make buic reusable component we following angualr element approch agin need to install element related dependencies and customization for that bundle file and on top of this for husky checkmark and csp configuration we need to do manually so to reduce this manual efforts of developer we created Automation script which all this approch pls give short and professional speech which I can speak in one minute during presention

Here's a concise and professional version of your speech:

"Our current approach for upgrading BUIC from Angular 2 to 10 or 16 involves three main steps: First, developers need to install Angular dependencies to generate the basic BUIC schema. Second, to generate the minified or compressed bundle file, we rely on a Webpack approach where developers have to install Webpack dependencies manually and customize Angular common files, following ETP standards. This process involves around 20 steps. Third, for making BUIC a reusable component, we use Angular Elements, requiring additional dependencies and customization. On top of that, developers manually configure Husky checkmarks and Content Security Policy (CSP). To streamline this process and reduce manual efforts, we created an automation script that integrates all these approaches into a single, automated workflow, making the process much more efficient for developers."

This keeps it short while touching on all the key points you need for your presentation.

To start your speech after presenting the title and two-line content, you can say something like this:

"Today, I will walk you through the process we followed for automating the upgrade of Angular components. The main objective of this automation is to simplify the repetitive tasks, enhance efficiency, and ensure our BUIC components are always up-to-date with the latest Angular versions. As you can see, the existing approach involves a series of manual steps including dependency installations, Webpack configuration, and integration of various packages. This manual process can be time-consuming and prone to errors. With the new automation approach, we've streamlined everything—from BUIC bundling to CSP validation, Checkmarx integration, and Husky automation—reducing the developer's effort significantly while maintaining consistency and accuracy."

This introduction sets the stage for your explanation of the differences between the existing and automated approaches.
