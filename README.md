Dear Saurabh and Team,
Thank you so much for the recognition and encouragement.
I would like to specially thank Kuldip for his great leadership and continuous support throughout this patent journey. Your efforts in clearly explaining the patent concept, guiding us to identify novel points, helping with diagrams, and motivating us at every step made a big difference. Your guidance truly helped us improve and move in the right direction.
Also, sincere thanks to all the leaders and team members mentioned for your valuable support and collaboration. This has been a great learning experience, and I’m grateful to be part of such a supportive team.
Looking forward to contributing more.
