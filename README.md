Hello Sir,

Sorry to disturb you, but I need some clarification. I recently noticed that all my access to the TFG Core and Extended Core Team has been removed. I checked with other SPOCs — they were also on Diwali vacation, but their access has not been removed.

I have been actively contributing to TFG Core for the past three years, participating in every event as a host and SPOC. Recently, I also hosted the GIFT Technopulse Quiz event and have supported several TFG conversions and training sessions in the past.

Could you please help me understand why my access was removed? I just want to confirm if there was any issue or mistake from my side. My manager and other members connected with TFG from my location have also observed that my DG access has been removed.

Requesting your kind clarification on this matter.

Thank you for your time and support.
