Hi Apurva and Amit,
I have one additional idea regarding the Angular Upgrade Utility.
Currently, we are using this utility to upgrade our Vue components efficiently. In a similar way, we can extend this concept to the WCAG accessibility side as well. We can design a Copilot-based prompt utility that can automatically analyze Angular templates and components, identify WCAG issues, suggest fixes, and even apply recommended changes directly in the code.
Along with fixing and recommending accessibility improvements, this utility can also generate a detailed accessibility report highlighting identified issues, applied fixes, and remaining recommendations. This will help us standardize accessibility implementation across components, reduce manual effort, and ensure better compliance with WCAG guidelines.
I believe this approach can significantly improve our accessibility quality, speed up remediation, and support consistent implementation across projects.
Let me know your thoughts on this — happy to discuss and explore further.
